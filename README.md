# InterviewPrepGPT

The purpose of this project was to build a GPT that helps to prepare behaviroal questions for intervews via langchain (for retriving info) and openai api.

This project is killed at OpenAI's OpenDev day (2023), which they released new apis that support **auto-retrievals** and **search** when users upload their pdf/docs, therefore defeat the purpose of this project. RIP.
